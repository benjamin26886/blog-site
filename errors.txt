First error encounterd logic error, I wanted to change the color of the text, and i set the color to red in the externall css file, but there was another bootstrap class conflciting with the color 
Second error, cannot post, i added the forms to the blog field that i created a route to the sub

Second Problem: I was having a problem trying to get the data from the user added onto into the posts list, The 
solution was that my approach was wrong, instead of focusing on trying to get the script.js file to add,
the title of the user post to the list of post, I should have used the index.ejs file instead, to solve i created add an
array, adn each time, Remeber also that the posts will not persist between sessions, so each time you add a post it will disapear

Third Problem: Another problem i was having was related to the backend side of things, i was trying to render the posts page, when 
the user creates a post the post will be added to the post list. When the user clicks on the posts list, there was a problem trying to render the other page,
However this was solved. WHat needed to happen was first the post.ejs file had to be iside of the views folder, second:// when setting up a route, make sure that the /route has the foward slash
Third:// when setting up a route, make sure you use render, with the.js extension 

Fourth Problem: I want that when the user clicks on their post inside of the post list, they are redirected to the post page, where
they should be able to see their post.👇🏿👇🏿👇🏿👇🏿👇🏿👇🏿👇🏿👇🏿👇🏿👇🏿👇🏿👇🏿👇🏿👇🏿👇🏿👇🏿👇🏿👇🏿👇🏿👇🏿

Solution, you need to update the post endpoint, you need to send the object of the post along with the post.ejs file
in the res.render.

Wrong Aproach:
when you click on publish you need to figure out a way, that when you add a post to the posts container, that you are passing data from the server to be added 
Try creating an object, the has the title and the body 

inside of the index.js file you need to handle the posts, so that when thje user makes a post, the server will grab the dats
from the req.body, and piush the data into an array, after that the array will be sent to the ejs tag in the ejs file 


you have 20 minutes to finsih 


1.send the title of the objects as a link 
how do you send an object from the array either as one entity or as the object as the title and content 
figure out how to send the title and and content inside of the posts
